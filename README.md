## Game Description

Pokémon Challenges is a two player turn based game inspired by the popular Pokémon videogames. In this game, each player is randomly assigned a pre-decided number of pokémons from an existing database. They carry out attacks on each other, aiming to lower the health of the other pokémon to zero. When its health reaches zero, the pokémon faints. If the player has any more pokémons left, they can be used until their health also depletes to zero. The first player to finish all pokémons loses the game.
